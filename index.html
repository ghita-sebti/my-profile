 		I'm a 22yo moroccan girl. I'm basically the profile type who enjoys the little things in life... (you can check them out below 👇) Currently doing my MS in Audencia business school, I constantly look out for opportunities to better orient myself in what I love. Since my youngest age I am extremely focused on the audiovisual field and artistic professions, more specifically cinema🎞. Also, I now love coding 😅! .

	 <h2> Taking pictures 📸</h2>
 	 <p>
 		To me, Photography is a fragment of time that will not come back, so I like to capture as much as I can ! It's all about the nature details. I am not so much into taking people but more landscapes and wildlife.

	 <h2> Spending time with my loved ones 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦</h2>
 	 <p>
 		It goes without saying that my family is all I treasure the most. They are the shoulder I lean on when my world is falling appart, they are the ear that listens to me when I need to share what I need. They are the sun of my sky, my pillar and everything that I can and cannot describe... Bless them all!

		 My other dog is a maltese called "Snow" also known as "Snowy". There he is !

     <p>
     	About him he's two years and he is just overexcited all the time. A real warmachine ! he never stops !
 		 A wise man said one day :
 		 <blockquote>"A dog is the only creature on Earth that loves you more than it loves itself."
 		 </blockquote>. He was not so wise as I do love them more than myself 😅!

	 <h2> Cinema 🎞</h2>
 	 <p>
 		Ever since I can remember, I have always been a film buff. Indeed, from my very young age, I was introduced to cinema without ever being able to really insert myself in and more attend it on the surface. Over my internships, I decided to make my dream a reality and make a small place in this field by attending to film festivals and reaching out to couples of production companies in Morocco. I got eager to go further and genuinely assert my potential by affecting the moroccan film industry. 
 		I also got to meet one of my favorite actors Simon Baker among others, during the 2019 Marrakech Film Festival. I have been so grateful for the whole experience and  felt so emotional as I have been allowed as a film enthusiast to prove their worth makes you more unique. so many of these people brought me huge inspiration.

	 <h2> Reading and writing 📚📖</h2>
 	 <p>
 		Reading books and writing essays have always been parts of my life. It has moved me in so many ways and inspired me to achieve my goals. I mostly read novels. But I'd say that my favorite book is Dostoïevski's "The White Nights". Ever since I have read this book, I  decided to write. First it was left to be a compendium of disorganized emotions, but as I kept writing, I realized I had something to share, which motivated me to complete my project. Reading and writing are both so rewarding to me when I consider myself a work in progress.

	 <h2> Sightseeing my own country 🇲🇦</h2>
 	 <p>
 		My Morocco ! This magical country borded by the Atlantic coast and the Mediterranean is above all an incredible contrast of landscapes, colors and smiles. I love to experience and capture each moments in each place whether it is a preserved nature spot or an ancestral rural one.
